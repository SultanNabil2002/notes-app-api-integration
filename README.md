# Notes App - REST API Integration 🚀

A modern web application built to manage notes efficiently. This project demonstrates the implementation of **RESTful API consumption** using modern JavaScript (ES6+), **Webpack** as a module bundler, and **Asynchronous Programming** concepts.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, and Delete notes directly via REST API.
* **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Utilizes `async/await` and `Fetch API` for smooth data transactions.
* **Component-Based:** Structured using modular components (Webpack).
* **Loading State:** Visual feedback during API data fetching.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures data integrity before sending to the server.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
* **Build Tool:** Webpack (with Babel Loader, CSS Loader).
* **Networking:** Fetch API.
* **Styling:** Responsive Grid Layout.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project showcases my ability to:
* Consume public endpoints (`https://notes-api.dicoding.dev/v2`) effectively.
* Manage project dependencies using `package.json`.
* Configure Webpack for development and production environments.
* Handle errors and promises in JavaScript.
